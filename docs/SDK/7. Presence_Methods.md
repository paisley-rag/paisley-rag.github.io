# Presence Methods

The presence methods in the Cerebellum SDK allow you to manage presence information for a specific channel. Presence information is used to track the online status of users in a channel, enabling features such as presence-based messaging and presence-based notifications.

## `enterPresenceSet`

```TypeScript
enterPresenceSet(
  channelName: string,
  state: State
): void
```

**Description**

Enters the user into the presence set of the specified channel. This method allows you to notify the server and other clients that a user has joined the channel, along with any associated state information.

**Arguments**

- **`channelName: string`**
  - **Description**: The name of the channel to which the user is entering the presence set.
- **`state: State`**
  - **Description**: An object representing the state information associated with the user. The state can contain any key-value pairs as needed.

**Return Type**

- **`void`**
  - **Description**: This method does not return a value.

**Example**

```TypeScript
cerebellum.enterPresenceSet("general", { username: "alice", status: "online" });
```

**Explanation**

- In this example, the user is entering the presence set for the channel `"general"`, with state information indicating the username and status. This information will be broadcast to other users in the channel.

## `leavePresenceSet`

```TypeScript
leavePresenceSet(channelName: string): void
```

**Description**

Leaves the presence set of the specified channel. This method notifies the server and other clients that a user is no longer in the presence channel.

**Arguments**

- **`channelName: string`**
  - **Description**: The name of the channel from which the user is leaving the presence set.

**Return Type**

- **`void`**
  - **Description**: This method does not return a value.

**Example**

```TypeScript
cerebellum.leavePresenceSet("general");
```

**Explanation**

- In this example, the user is leaving the presence set for the channel `"general"`. Other users will be informed that the user is no longer present in the channel.

---

## `getPresenceSetMembers`

```TypeScript
getPresenceSetMembers(channelName: string): Promise<State[]>
```

**Description**

Retrieves the current members in the presence set of the specified channel. This method allows you to get the list of users currently in the channel and their associated state information.

Note this is a promise that will resolve with the current members in the presence set.

**Arguments**

- **`channelName: string`**
  - **Description**: The name of the channel whose presence set members are to be retrieved.

**Return Type**

- **`Promise<State[]>`**
  - **Description**: Returns a promise that resolves to an array of `State` objects representing the members of the presence set.
  - Note that the `State` interface is defined as follows, however it will always contain a `socketId` property, to uniquely identify the users in the presence set:
- **`State` Interface**:
    ```typescript
    interface State {
      [key: string]: string;
      socketId: string;
    }
    ```

  - **Description**: An object where the keys and values are user-defined and can contain any relevant information about the user.

**Example**

```TypeScript
const presenceMembers = await cerebellum.getPresenceSetMembers("general");

console.log("Current members in the presence set:", members);
```

**Explanation**

- In this example, `getPresenceSetMembers` is called with the channel name `"general"`. The returned promise resolves to an array of state objects, each representing a member of the presence set.

## `subscribeToPresenceJoins`

```TypeScript
subscribeToPresenceJoins(channelName: string, callback: (state: State) => void): void

**Arguments**

- **`channelName: string`**
  - **Description**: The name of the channel for which to subscribe to presence join events.
- **`callback: (state: State) => void`**
  - **Description**: A callback function that will be invoked when a user joins the presence set. The function receives a `State` object representing the state information of the user who joined.

**Callback Argument**

- **`state: State`**
  - **Description**: The callback function receives a `State` object representing the state information of the user who joined. The `State` interface is defined as follows:
  - Note that the `State` interface is defined as follows, however it will always contain a `socketId` property, to uniquely identify the users in the presence set:
- **`State` Interface**:
  ```typescript
  interface State {
    [key: string]: string;
    socketId: string;
  }
  ```

cerebellum.subscribeToPresenceJoins("general", (state) => {
  console.log("User joined with state:", state);
});
```

**Explanation**

- In this example, `subscribeToPresenceJoins` is used to listen for join events in the channel `"general"`. When a user joins, the provided callback function is executed with the state information of the new user.
